# What is a Cluster?
A Kubernetes Cluster is a set of machines (nodes) that work together to run your containerized applications.

A Kubernetes Cluster is the whole system.
It is made up of:
- Control Plane (Master Node) â†’ the brain.
- Worker Nodes â†’ the machines that run apps.
Purpose: Provides a unified platform to run, scale, and manage containerized applications.
ðŸ‘‰ Analogy: A cluster is like a company.
When you deploy Kubernetes, you get a Cluster.
# what is a Nodes(Minions/Server)?
A Node in Kubernetes is a worker machine (physical server or virtual machine) where your application workloads (Pods) run.
Each node is part of a cluster.
- Nodes are managed by the Control Plane.
- A cluster can have many nodes to handle scaling and resilience.
ðŸ‘‰ Think of a Kubernetes cluster as a factory, and each Node is a worker in that factory.
# What is a Pod in Kubernetes?
A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
- It runs one or more containers together with shared network and storage.
- Kubernetes creates, scales, and heals Pods automatically.
# The differences between Cluster, Node, and Pod in Kubernetes (K8s).

| ----------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------- |
| **Cluster** | Whole Kubernetes system         | Control plane + many nodes  | Manage and orchestrate apps | City      |
| **Node**    | A single machine in the cluster | Pods (via Kubelet, runtime) | Provides resources for apps | Building  |
| **Pod**     | Smallest deployable unit        | One or more containers      | Runs the actual app         | Apartment |
